How to use:
git clone https://github.com/SchorchedVenom/Hashcat-Automation-Utility
cd Hashcat-Automation-Utility
python3 hau.py

This Hashcat-Automation-Utility written by me has no affiliation with any other hashcat utility or the hashcat project itself
I wrote this for myself to speed up using hashcat and for people new to the tool
After running python3 hau.py the tool will walk you through everything you need to do

Tested on Windows 10 and Kali Linux
Should work on OSx and other Linux Distros though

Windows and OSx users be aware that after the command is generated for you at the end you may want to copy the command
As you may get a error from hashcat from not executing it with in its directory unless you have an envrionment variable set.
